# HOI4-at-Home

A Python-based project inspired by Hearts of Iron 4 (HOI4) to simulate or replicate certain game elements in a local environment. This project aims to provide a platform for experimenting with HOI4-like mechanics, learning, or modding purposes—all from your own machine.

## About the Project

**HOI4-at-Home** is designed for fans of Paradox Interactive's Hearts of Iron 4, or anyone interested in strategy game mechanics. By running a local Python environment, you can:
- Experiment with gameplay logic similar to HOI4.
- Modify or extend the code to test alternative features or balance changes.
- Learn about AI decision-making, resource management, or event scripting in a simplified environment.

Whether you are a modder, a game developer, or just curious, HOI4-at-Home offers a sandbox for exploration and learning.

## Features

- **Python-based Framework**: Easy to modify and extend using basic Python.
- **Core Mechanics Simulation**: Manage resources, production, or other mechanics inspired by HOI4.
- **Modular Design**: Add or remove features as you see fit.
- **Community-Driven**: Contributions and suggestions are always welcome to shape the project’s roadmap.

## Getting Started

This section explains how to set up the project locally. If you encounter any issues, please open an [issue](https://github.com/Harukunnn/HOI4-at-Home/issues).

### Prerequisites

- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher is recommended)
- A working terminal or command prompt

### Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harukunnn/HOI4-at-Home.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd HOI4-at-Home
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If no `requirements.txt` exists, install relevant dependencies as needed.)*

4. **Environment Setup** *(optional)*:
   - Create and activate a virtual environment, if desired:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - Configure any environment variables if the project requires them.

### Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can start experimenting with HOI4-at-Home:

1. **Run the main script** (if provided):
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover
   ```
3. Explore or modify code within the modules to customize game mechanics.
